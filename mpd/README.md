# MPD

Note: Temporarily not built until we can make per-variant (Silverblue, Kinoite,
CoreOS) builds or we directly duplicate this sysext for each variant.

Includes:
- [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org) (Server-side application for playing music)
- [mpc](https://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc) (A minimalist command line interface to MPD)
- [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2) (Control MPD like any other application with multimedia keys etc)
- [ncmpcpp](https://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp) (A TUI MPD client)

Works with (Flatpak) GUI Clients like [plattenalbum](https://github.com/SoongNoonien/plattenalbum) and [Cantata](https://github.com/nullobsi/cantata).

# Usage

(Install like any other sysext at the moment)

`mkdir -p ~/.config/mpd`

stock config setup:

`cp /usr/etc/mpd.conf ~/.config/mpd`

[sensible default config](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/c43f390f07098c42db5efce654b07870951b512a/.config/mpd/mpd.conf) (Pipewire):

`systemctl --user enable --now mpd mpDris2`

Use localhost and port 6600 to connect with the client.

# Why

MPD is in RPMFusion, mpDris2 behaves weirdly/can't autostart in a quadlet/distrobox.
